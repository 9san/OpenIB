<p>
		9san.ch is a website running on <a href="https://github.com/9san/OpenIB-Reloaded" target="_blank">OpenIB Reloaded</a> 
		as a result of the development for Infinity and OpenIB being permanently dead as the repository owners are no longer active and 8chan going closed source (with their embarassingly ugly design).<br>
		The fork was written by and for 9channel, but is released Open Source under a modified MIT license which can be found <a href="/LICENSE.md" target="_blank">here</a>.
	</p><p>
		<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/9san/OpenIB-Reloaded">OpenIB Reloaded</a> is an improved and actively developed version of 
		<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/OpenIB/OpenIB">OpenIB</a> 
		which is a security fork based on <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/ctrlcctrlv/infinity">Infinity</a> which is a public board creation fork based on 
		<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/vichan-devel/vichan">vichan</a> which is an old, but maintained fork of 
		<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/ctrlcctrlv/infinity">Tinyboard</a> which was a once upon a time cutting edge imageboard software in terms of performance, but now outdated and defunct.
